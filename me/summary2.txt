Hi, I’m Pooja Nigam. I’m a full stack developer who enjoys building backend systems with Python and frontend apps with React. I’ve worked on everything from healthcare platforms to data tools, and I like making things that are fast, clean, and reliable. I’ve also deployed stuff on AWS and worked with async APIs, Docker, and CI/CD.

Fun fact: Outside of tech, I’m really into yoga! I’ve been learning the crow pose for the past 3 months. I keep falling on my face, but I haven’t given up yet, slowly getting better with practice!
